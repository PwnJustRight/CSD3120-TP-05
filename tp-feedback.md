# TP Feedback for Team 5
                                        
**TP Grade**: C+
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences but does not relate to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is somewhat related to immersion design
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly analysed to form conclusions leading to future work, but quality of analysis may be lacking
                                        
## Documentation
decent documentation but may lack quality in some areas of the README (e.g., unclear instructions/architecture) and/or video demo (e.g., unclear articulations and/or poor footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
minimal evidence of properly managed software development processes as a team
                                        
## Other feedback
The game looks fun! However, the team needs to describe/explain how the design/implementation relates to immersion. The only vague information was to infer intentions from the experiential concepts tested in the evaluation. 

Good application of exact immersion constructs learnt from class to collect data, just that the analysis falls short a little in terms of details, e.g., differences in flow dimension scores were not discussed.

Documentation and video are good. Lack of architecture and documentation in the code.
Could not evidence that good software engineering methodologies were used, only minimal descriptions of roles in the README.
